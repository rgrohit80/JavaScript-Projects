                Napoleon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən ˈboʊnəpɑːrt/[1]; French: Napoléon [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt]; 15 August 1769 –
                5 May 1821), born Napoleone di Buonaparte (Italian: [napoleˈoːne di ˌbwɔnaˈparte]), was a French
                statesman and military leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several
                successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was Emperor of the French as Napoleon I
                from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the Hundred Days. Napoleon dominated European and
                global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the
                Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire
                that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of
                the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools
                worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and
                controversial leaders in human history.
